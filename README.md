## Projects 

### 1. Final Year Undergraduate Research Project 
#### üìä Digital Engagement Communication Scale (DECS)  
**Goal:** Develop & validate a 36-item scale measuring online confidence, self-esteem, social anxiety, and perceived social support.  

**Approach:**  
- Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) in R (n = 87)  
- Parallel analysis ‚Üí 3-factor structure  
- Items refined based on KMO, Bartlett‚Äôs test, and loading thresholds  

**Key Findings:**  
- **Factors:** Perceived Social Support, Social Anxiety, Confidence & Engagement  
- **Reliability:** Œ± = .84‚Äì.87  
- **Model Fit:** RMSEA = .06, RMSR = .06  
- **Validation:** Moderate correlations with Internet Self-efficacy Scale  

**Impact:**  
A reliable tool for assessing psychological dimensions of digital communication in research & applied settings.

### 2. Psychometric Analysis Report 
#### üéì Enterprise Grad Scheme: Education Engagement & Retention

## Goal
Investigate whether **academic self-efficacy, goal orientation, and perceived teacher support** predict education engagement, as part of a report for **Enterprise Rent-A-Car‚Äôs graduate retention program**.  

## Approach
- **Participants:** 41 university students (27 female, 13 male, 1 non-binary)  
- **Method:** Online survey using validated scales (NGSE, GOS, CSSS, SES)  
- **Analysis:** Multiple regression to examine predictors of education engagement  

## Key Findings
- **Significant predictors:** Academic self-efficacy (Œ≤ = .60) and perceived teacher support (Œ≤ = .33)  
- **Non-significant predictor:** Goal orientation (Œ≤ = -.06)  
- **Model fit:** F(3,35) = 12.91, p < .01, explaining 52.5% of variance in engagement  
- **Reliability:** Cronbach‚Äôs Œ± = .69‚Äì.87  
- **Correlations:** Self-efficacy r = .65***, Teacher support r = .41**  

## Impact
Highlights factors that **positively influence engagement**, offering insights for improving **graduate retention strategies** and supporting student success.

### 3. Experimental Analysis Report
#### üéß Perceptual Load & Music Tempo: Impact on Reaction Times  
**Goal:** Examine how perceptual load and background music tempo influence reaction times in a visual search task.  

**Method:**  
- **Participants:** 42 (28F, 14M)  
- **Design:** Two-way repeated measures ANOVA  
- **Variables:**  
  - Perceptual load (high vs. low)  
  - Music tempo (high, low, none)  
- Task: Visual search (‚ÄúJ‚Äù if orange ‚ÄòL‚Äô present, ‚ÄúF‚Äù if absent) via Gorilla.sc  

**Key Findings:**  
- **Perceptual load:** Significant negative effect (*p* < .001) ‚Üí slower reaction times under high load.  
- **Music tempo:** Non-significant effect.  
- **Interaction:** Non-significant.  

**Impact:**  
Higher perceptual load reduces processing speed regardless of music tempo. Insights may help inform workload optimisation in applied settings.
