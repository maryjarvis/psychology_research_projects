# 📊 Digital Engagement Communication Scale (DECS)

## 🧠 Project Title  
**The Impact of Digital Interactions and Engagement on Confidence, Self-Esteem, Social Anxiety, and Perceived Social Support**

## 📘 Overview

This project introduces and validates a 36-item scale to measure psychological dimensions of digital communication, including:

- Confidence & Self-esteem  
- Social Anxiety  
- Perceived Social Support  

Using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) in **R**, the study identifies a reliable three-factor structure. The findings are validated using the Internet Self-efficacy Scale (ISS).

## 🔍 Abstract

With social media use increasingly prevalent, especially among young adults, there is a lack of measures exploring the impact of confidence and self-esteem, social anxiety, and perceived social support within online interactions. This study introduces a new 36-item scale, developed based on prior research, to measure Digital Engagement Communication.

An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to examine the structure of the newly developed scale, using a sample of 87 participants aged 18 to 56. The EFA revealed a three-factor solution, demonstrating good internal consistency and reliability. The findings were validated by the Internet Self-efficacy Scale (Kim & Glassman, 2013) to underscore its relevance for understanding the factors influencing digital engagement.

The study provides valuable insights for assessing how confidence and self-esteem, social anxiety, and perceived social support shape online interactions, offering a tool for further exploration of digital communication engagement behaviours.
